# WeakAliasDetermination

Names that are explicitly marked as low quality either by their `source` list, or by `plaid` by a series of additional checks done by Plaid. Plaid does not ever surface a hit as a result of a weak name alone. If a name has no quality issues, this value will be `none`.


## Values

| Name     | Value    |
| -------- | -------- |
| `NONE`   | none     |
| `SOURCE` | source   |
| `PLAID`  | plaid    |
