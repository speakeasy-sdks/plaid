    `dashboard` - The resource was created or updated by a member of your team via the Plaid dashboard.

    `api` - The resource was created or updated via the Plaid API.

    `system` - The resource was created or updated automatically by a part of the Plaid Beacon system. For example, if another business using Plaid Beacon created a fraud report that matched one of your users, your matching user's status would automatically be updated and the audit trail source would be `system`.

    `bulk_import` - The resource was created or updated as part of a bulk import process. For example, if your company provided a CSV of user data as part of your initial onboarding, the audit trail source would be `bulk_import`.
