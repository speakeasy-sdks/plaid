    `UNDER_REVIEW`: The end customer has been created and enabled in the non-Production environments. The end customer must be manually reviewed by the Plaid team before it can be enabled in production, at which point its status will automatically transition to `PENDING_ENABLEMENT` or `DENIED`.

    `PENDING_ENABLEMENT`: The end customer is ready to be enabled in the Production environment. Call the `/partner/customer/enable` endpoint to enable the end customer in Production.

    `ACTIVE`: The end customer has been enabled in all environments.

    `DENIED`: The end customer has been created and enabled in the non-Production environments, but it did not pass review by the Plaid team and therefore cannot be enabled in the Production environment. Talk to your Account Manager for more information.
