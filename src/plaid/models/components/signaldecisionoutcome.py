    `APPROVE`: approve the transaction without requiring further actions from your customers. For example, use this field if you are placing a standard hold for all the approved transactions before making funds available to your customers. You should also use this field if you decide to accelerate the fund availability for your customers.

    `REVIEW`: the transaction requires manual review

    `REJECT`: reject the transaction
