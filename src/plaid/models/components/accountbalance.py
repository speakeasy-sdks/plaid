    r"""The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

    For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

    For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

    For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

    Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

    Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

    If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.

    r"""The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

    For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

    For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

    For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

    Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

    When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.
